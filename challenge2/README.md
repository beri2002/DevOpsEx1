# C Server-Client Example

This project demonstrates a simple server-client communication setup using C++ and socket programming. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, receives messages, and prints them. The client connects to the server, sends a message, and displays the response received from the server.

## Prerequisites

- C compiler
- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, etc.)

## Build Instructions

```sh
gcc -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c
```

## Running the Server
```sh
./server
./client
```
