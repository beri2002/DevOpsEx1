# C++ Server-Client Example

This project demonstrates a simple server-client communication setup using C++ and socket programming. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, receives messages, and prints them. The client connects to the server, sends a message, and displays the response received from the server.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler that supports at least C++11 standard
- CMake build system (minimum version 3.0)
- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, etc.)

## Build Instructions

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running the Server
```sh
./server
./client
```
